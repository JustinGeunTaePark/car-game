  ## What I have done today
    -> Merged my branch into master and the grid interface
    -> Restructured the project so it follows standard Java project structure

  ## What I will do next
    -> Merge the Grid and GUI code together
    -> Discuss with the group the next weeks sprint

  ## Anything in my way ?
    ->  Time constraints mainly with the assignment 2 due date coming up

  ## What I have done today:
    -> Helped merge the GUI and Grid code together
    -> Reviewed and partially refactored some of the code
    -> Broke down the ideas and goals that still need to be completed
    -> Distributed the goals between the members

  ## What I will do next:
    -> Aggregate the GUI code together so similar code structures are grouped together
      - Avoids code duplication
    -> Clean up the GUI
      - Smooth scrolling of the vehicle blocks
      - Create a consistent theme for the app in general (thinking dark grey/orange)
    -> Work on the vehicle classes to prevent cars from being able to be lifted from their row/column
    -> Implement a basic vehicle layout

   ## Anything in my way ?
    -> Group communication and delegation of tasks needs to be done effectively so individual people don't
      end up doing too much
